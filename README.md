# üöÄ Getting Started with Rep Coach

This guide will help you set up the Rep Coach project locally.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- pnpm
- OpenAI API key
- Docker (for local Supabase)

## üìù Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poteris/ocpb.git
cd ocpb
```

2. Create environment configuration:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with:

```env
SUPABASE_URL=
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

4. Start the local Supabase instance:

```bash
pnpm db:start
```

Important notes:

- If Supabase is already running locally, stop it first: `pnpm db:stop`
- To completely reset the database: `pnpm db:reset:all` (‚ö†Ô∏è This will erase all data)

5. Launch the application:
- This command starts the Next.js development server which offers hot reloading
```bash
pnpm dev
```

6. Smoke test the application with Playwright E2E tests:

- Before first run, install playwright browsers and set the host and port of your dev server:
```bash
pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps
echo E2E_TEST_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 >> ./frontend/.env
echo USE_MOCK_OPENAI=true >> ./frontend/.env
```
- Then to execute the E2E smoke test suite:
```bash
pnpm dev && pnpm test:ui
```
- There is also a github action that invokes the Playwright E2E smoke test suite for a given branch, when the associated PR is marked as Ready for Review
